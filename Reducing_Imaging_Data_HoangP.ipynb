    "#####                        Even without any light or any source of light, the CCD pixel sensor still have some variation of signal coming through. Effectively by taking the bias, we are taking the data of signal that the CCD will pick up while there is no signal (or photon) go in throught the CCD or readout signal. When we take an actual light image, we can eliminate this effect by remove the bias file we take, or in a more simple term, using the image subtract the bias. Therefore the data of the observed object will be more accurate."
